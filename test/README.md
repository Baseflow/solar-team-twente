# Testing

## Test naming and structure

Every test file has the following name structure:
`{file_you_are_testing}_test.dart`
Internally test files are organized like so:

```dart
void main() {
  group('Group name, for example a class name or a series of actions in the class', () {
    test('Test name, for example a method name', () {
      // Test code
    });
  });
}
```

## Why Descriptions Matter:

    Readability: Clear descriptions make tests easier to understand, especially when you revisit them or collaborate with others.
    Maintainability: Good descriptions help pinpoint what went wrong if a test fails.
    Organization: Descriptions can help categorize tests into logical groups.

## How to Construct a Description

A well-formed Flutter widget test description often follows this pattern:

`"should [behavior or outcome] when [condition]"`

### Let's break it down:

    should: Clearly states the expected behavior of the widget being tested.
    [behavior or outcome]: Describes what the widget should do, what it should render, or how its state should change.
    when: Specifies the circumstances or interactions that trigger the behavior.

### Examples

    "should display a greeting when the name field is filled"
    "should increment the counter when the button is tapped"
    "should show an error message when the form is submitted with invalid data"
    "should render an empty list when there are no items"

### Tips for Writing Good Descriptions

    Be Specific: Avoid generic descriptions like "should work." Focus on the exact behavior you're testing.
    Use the User's Perspective: Frame descriptions in terms of how a user would interact with the UI and what the expected results would be.
    Consider Context: If necessary, include relevant details like device orientation, screen size, or data states.
    Keep it Concise: Descriptions should be clear yet succinct.

### Example test:

```dart
// Sample of simple widget test
void main() {
  // Define a test. The TestWidgets function also provides a WidgetTester
  // to work with. The WidgetTester allows you to build and interact
  // with widgets in the test environment.
  testWidgets('Should display title text `Counter`', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Test code goes here.
    // Create the widget by telling the tester to build it.
    await tester.pumpWidget(
      const MaterialAppHelper(
        child: CounterPage(),
      ),
    );
    // Use the `findsOneWidget` matcher provided by flutter_test to verify
    // that the Text widgets appear exactly once in the widget tree.
    expect(find.text('Counter'), findsOneWidget);
  });
}

```
